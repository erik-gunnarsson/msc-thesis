## Methodology 

### ======================== Jan 22th ideas ========================

*“Labour-market institutions shape how European labour markets adjust to ICT-driven technological change.”*

Employment Structure ⇒ Do coordinated wage-bargaining institutions mitigate job polarization and routine-task displacement induced by ICT-driven technological change?


**Spins:**
[Primary] Employment Structure ⇒ Do coordinated wage-bargaining institutions mitigate job polarization and routine-task displacement induced by ICT-driven technological change?
[Secondary] mechanism / heterogeneity) ⇒  Are ICT shocks more disruptive for routine occupations in countries with decentralized bargaining systems?

**Interaction Logic: **

Outcomei,o,c,t​=β1​ICTs,c,t−1​+β2​Institutionc,t​+β3​(ICTs,c,t-1 × Institutionc,t​)+FE+Controls+ε

**Outcome**
- Routine employment share
- Middle-skill employment share
- Job polarization index
 (e.g. high-skill + low-skill − middle-skill)
- ICT = EU KLEMS ICT intensity in worker’s industry
- Institution = ICTWSS bargaining variable
- Controls:
- FE:
- Identification comes from:
- ICT variation across industries
- Institutional variation across countries

 
#### Datasets

**Backbone - EU-LFS**
Role: Labour-market outcomes (micro)

You will use it for:
Occupation-based employment structure
Routine vs non-routine task exposure
Education × occupation × industry × country × year

Interpretation 
This is your dependent-variable engine. (Employment-composition engine)


**Institutions - OECD/AIAS ICTWSS**
Role: Institutional moderators

You can credibly use:
Collective bargaining coverage
Bargaining level (firm / sector / national)
Bargaining coordination
Union density

These are:
Annual or slow-moving
Country-level
Widely accepted

Interpretation 
Institutions do not directly determine employment structure in the model; they moderate how ICT shocks translate into polarization and routine displacement.

**ICT Technology -  EU KLEMS** 
Role: Technology shock (non-robot)

Use:
ICT capital services
ICT investment share (% of total capital)
Country × industry × year

Interpretation:
Exposure to digital technologies, software, data infrastructure
Standard European proxy for ICT-biased technical change

Conceptual alignment (new emphasis):
ICT deepening → task substitution → routine-intensive job decline → polarization
Institutions shape the adjustment margin (wage compression, redeployment, internal labor markets).
